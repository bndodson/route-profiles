Route,Summary,Passenger Comfort,Reliability,Running Times,Stop Spacing
21,"Route 21 provides very direct connections to Ashmont Station and Forest Hills Station from dense neighborhoods in Dorchester. Its weekday ridership is very high, but Saturday ridership is only moderate and Sunday ridership is low. This is due, at least in part, to the infrequent weekend service that is provided.","The MBTA desires that passengers travel in relatively comfortable conditions. At the same time, the MBTA’s definition of comfort reflects the very high volume environment in which the MBTA operates, and that some passengers may have to stand for a portion of their trip. More specifically, at least 92% of passengers’ travel times should be in comfortable conditions, and ideally, at least 96% of travel times should be in comfortable conditions. Comfortable conditions are considered to be 140% or less of seated capacity during high volume periods and 125% or less during other periods.","Route 21’s overall reliability is 70% on weekdays, 73% on Saturdays, and 78% on Sundays (see Table 4).Weekday and Saturday reliability meets or exceed the minimum standard of 70% but falls below the target of 75%.Sunday reliability exceeds the target of 75%.","On inbound trips, actual running times vary from scheduled running times, with actual times longer between 6:00 AM and 7:00 AM and from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM (see Figure 10).During these periods, actual times are up to five minutes longer than scheduled times. For most of the rest of the day, actual times are shorter, including in the peak periods, when shorter scheduled running times could enable better frequencies.","Stops are spaced particularly closely along Route 21’s core ridership area, between Dorchester Avenue and Blue Hill Avenue. This 1.4-mile segment has 13 stops, an average of nine stops per mile. Consolidating stops along this corridor would provide more reliable service and produce more consistent ridership activity at each stop."
